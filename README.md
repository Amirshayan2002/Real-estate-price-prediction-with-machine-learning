Real estate price prediction with machine learning 






Real estate price prediction is a popular application of machine learning. It involves using historical data to train a model that can predict the price of a property based on its features. These features can include the location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other related factors. The model can then be used to make predictions on new data.

There are many machine learning algorithms that can be used for real estate price prediction, including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, decision trees, and Random Forest Classifier algorithms12. Researchers have also proposed improved machine learning techniques for housing price prediction3.


In conclusion, real estate price prediction is an exciting field that has the potential to revolutionize the real estate industry. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can make more accurate predictions about the price of a property, which can help buyers and sellers make more informed decision
